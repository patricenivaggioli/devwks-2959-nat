# 4. Multi Agent Orchestration

![alt text](./images/lab4.png)

In this lab, we showcase how the NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit (NAT) can be used to use a mixture of inbuilt tools and agents, as well as custom tools and workflows. Multi-agent orchestration is an important concept in many agentic AI facets: notably runtime and token efficiency. Here we aim to show how simple multi-agent orchestration is able to be implemented when using NAT. We show how an orchestration agent can call tools and sub-agents to facilitate complex tasks.

By the conclusion of this example, we will create a simple mixture-of-agents that serves as an assistant in retail sales.

**Note:** _This is just an example agent system that uses dummy data. The intention is to demonstrate some of the capabilities of this toolkit and how a new user can get familiar with it._

This agent system has:

1. A **supervisor** agent that routes incoming requests to the downstream agent expert
2. A **data insight agent** that is a tool-calling agent capable of answering questions about sales data
3. A **RAG agent** that is capable of answering questions about products using context from a product catalog
4. A **data visualization agent** that is capable of plotting graphs and trends

We demonstrate the following capabilities:
* RAG
* Multi-framework support
* Human-in-the-Loop
* Multi-agent support

## 4.1 Data Analysis/Plotting Tools

This is a new set of tools that will be registered to the data analysis and plotting agent. This set of tools allows the registered agent to plot the results of upstream data analysis tasks.

### 4.1.1 Define Analysis/Plotting Tools

```

### 4.1.2 Install matplotlib

As `data_visualization_tools.py` uses `matplotlib` library, let's intall it:

```bash
uv pip install matplotlib
```

### 4.1.3 Register the tools

```bash
cd ~/nemo-agent-toolkit/
cat >> retail_sales_agent/src/retail_sales_agent/register.py <<'EOF'

from . import data_visualization_tools
EOF
```

## 4.2 Adding an Agent Orchestrator

### 4.2.1 Agent Orchestrator Workflow Configuration File

Next, we introduce a new workflow configuration file. Upon first glance, this configuration file may seem complex. However, when we classify the available tools and delegate them to an agent, it will begin to make intuitive sense how sub-tasks in a workflow can be divided amongst the best fit agent.

In this multi-agent orchestration system, we divide responsibilities among specialized agents, each equipped with tools that match their domain expertise:

**1. Data Analysis Agent**.  
- **Tools:** `total_product_sales_data`, `sales_per_day`, `detect_outliers`.  
- **Justification:** This agent handles raw data processing and statistical analysis. These tools extract, aggregate, and analyze sales data, making it the expert for answering questions about sales trends, patterns, and anomalies. By isolating data analysis tasks, we ensure consistent and reliable data interpretation.

**2. Visualization Agent**.  
- **Tools:** `plot_total_product_sales`, `plot_sales_per_day`, `plot_average_daily_revenue`.  
- **Justification:** This agent specializes in creating visual representations of data. Visualization requires different expertise than raw data analysis—it involves understanding chart types, formatting, and visual communication. Separating this from data analysis allows the agent to focus on producing clear, effective visualizations without mixing concerns.

**3. Knowledge Retrieval Agent (RAG)**.  
- **Tools:** `llama_index_rag_tool`.  
- **Justification:** This agent accesses external knowledge bases and documentation through retrieval-augmented generation. It handles questions that require contextual information beyond the sales data itself, such as business policies, product information, or historical context. This separation ensures that knowledge retrieval doesn't interfere with computational tasks.

**4. Orchestrator Agent (Top-Level)**.  
- **Tools:** None (delegates to sub-agents).  
- **Justification:** The orchestrator doesn't perform tasks directly but instead routes requests to the appropriate expert agent. This design pattern mirrors real-world organizational structures where a manager delegates to specialists. It enables complex workflows where multiple agents collaborate, each contributing their expertise to solve multi-faceted problems.  

This architecture provides several benefits:

- **Modularity:** Each agent can be updated or replaced independently. 
- **Clarity:** Tool responsibilities are clearly defined and scoped. 
- **Scalability:** New agents and tools can be added without disrupting existing ones. 
- **Efficiency:** Agents only load and reason about tools relevant to their domain. 

**Note:** _You will notice in the below configuration that no tools are directly called by the workflow-level agent. Instead, it delegates specifically to expert agents based on the request_

### 4.2.2 Running the Workflow

Next we can run the workflow:

```bash
cd ~/nemo-agent-toolkit/
nat run --config_file retail_sales_agent/configs/config_multi_agent.yml \
  --input "What is the Ark S12 Ultra tablet and what are its specifications?" \
  --input "How do laptop sales compare to phone sales?" \
  --input "Plot average daily revenue"
cp average_daily_revenue.png /var/www/html/lab/images/average_daily_revenue.png
```

You should have the following output:
