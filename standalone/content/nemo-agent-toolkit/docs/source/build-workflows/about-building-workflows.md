# About Building NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit Workflows

In NeMo Agent Toolkit, a workflow defines which [functions](./functions-and-function-groups/functions.md) and [models](./llms/index.md) are used to perform a given task or series of tasks. A workflow definition is specified in a [YAML configuration file](#understanding-the-workflow-configuration-file). The `workflow` section of the configuration file defines the workflow itself, and specifies a function, typically an [agent](../components/agents/index.md), which will orchestrate which functions and models are called to complete the given task.

## Understanding the Workflow Configuration File

The workflow configuration file is a YAML file that specifies the [tools](./functions-and-function-groups/functions.md#agents-and-tools) and models to use in a workflow, along with general configuration settings. This section examines the configuration of the `examples/getting_started/simple_web_query` workflow to show how they are organized.

`examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml`:

```yaml
functions:
  webpage_query:
    _type: webpage_query
    webpage_url: https://docs.smith.langchain.com
    description: "Search for information about LangSmith. For any questions about LangSmith, you must use this tool!"
    embedder_name: nv-embedqa-e5-v5
    chunk_size: 512
  current_datetime:
    _type: current_datetime

llms:
  nim_llm:
    _type: nim
    model_name: meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct
    temperature: 0.0

embedders:
  nv-embedqa-e5-v5:
    _type: nim
    model_name: nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5

workflow:
  _type: react_agent
  tool_names: [webpage_query, current_datetime]
  llm_name: nim_llm
  verbose: true
  parse_agent_response_max_retries: 3
```

This workflow configuration is divided into four sections: `functions`, `llms`, `embedders`, and `workflow`. The `functions` section contains the tools used in the workflow, while `llms` and `embedders` define the models used in the workflow, and lastly the `workflow` section ties the other sections together and defines the workflow itself.

The workflow itself is typically an agent, however any NeMo Agent Toolkit function can be used as a workflow. Refer to the [Agents](../components/agents/index.md) documentation for more details on the agents that are included in NeMo Agent Toolkit.

In this workflow, the `webpage_query` tool queries the LangSmith User Guide, and the `current_datetime` tool gets the current date and time. The `description` entry instructs the LLM when and how to use the tool. In this case, the workflow explicitly defines `description` for the `webpage_query` tool.

The `webpage_query` tool uses the `nv-embedqa-e5-v5` embedder, which is defined in the `embedders` section.

For details on workflow configuration, including sections not utilized in the above example, refer to the [Workflow Configuration](./workflow-configuration.md) document.

## Using Agents With Workflows

The following are [agents](../components/agents/index.md) offered by NeMo Agent Toolkit:

- [Automatic Memory Wrapper Agent](../components/agents/auto-memory-wrapper/index.md)
- [ReAct Agent](../components/agents/react-agent/index.md)
- [Reasoning Agent](../components/agents/reasoning-agent/index.md)
- [ReWOO Agent](../components/agents/rewoo-agent/index.md)
- [Responses API and Agent](../components/agents/responses-api-and-agent/index.md)
- [Tool Calling Agent](../components/agents/tool-calling-agent/index.md)

## Using Control Flow Components With Workflows

The following are control flow components offered by NeMo Agent Toolkit:

- [Router Agent](../components/agents/router-agent/index.md)
- [Sequential Executor](../components/agents/sequential-executor/index.md)
