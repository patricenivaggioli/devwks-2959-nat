# Configure the Router Agent
Configure the NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit router agent as a [workflow](../../../build-workflows/about-building-workflows.md) or a [function](../../../build-workflows/functions-and-function-groups/functions.md). The router agent workflow consists of two phases: routing and execution.

## Requirements
The router agent requires the `nvidia-nat[langchain]` plugin to be installed, which can be installed with one of the following commands.

If you have performed a source code checkout:

```bash
uv pip install -e '.[langchain]'
```

If you have installed the NeMo Agent Toolkit from a package:

```bash
uv pip install "nvidia-nat[langchain]"
```

## Configuration

The router agent may be used as a workflow or a function.

### Example 1: Router Agent as a Workflow to Configure `config.yml`
To use the router agent as a workflow, configure the YAML file as follows:
```yaml
workflow:
  _type: router_agent
  branches: [fruit_advisor, city_advisor, literature_advisor]
  llm_name: nim_llm
  detailed_logs: true
```
### Example 2: Router Agent as a Function to Configure `config.yml`
To use the router agent as a function, configure the YAML file as follows:
```yaml
functions:
  fruit_advisor:
    _type: fruit_advisor
    description: "Provides recommendations for fruits based on user preferences"
  city_advisor:
    _type: city_advisor
    description: "Suggests cities to visit based on user interests"
  router_agent:
    _type: router_agent
    branches: [fruit_advisor, city_advisor]
    llm_name: agent_llm
    description: "Routes user requests to the most appropriate advisor"
    max_router_retries: 3
```

### Configurable Options
The router agent supports the following required and optional configurations.

#### Required Options

* `workflow_alias`: Defaults to `None`. The alias of the workflow. Useful when the router agent is configured as a workflow and needs to expose a customized name as a tool.

* `branches`: A list of available [tools](../../../build-workflows/functions-and-function-groups/functions.md#agents-and-tools), functions, or agents that the router can direct requests to. These branches must be configured in the YAML file.

* `llm_name`: The language model used for request analysis and routing decisions. The [LLM](../../../build-workflows/llms/index.md) must be configured in the YAML file.

#### Optional Options

* `description`: Defaults to "Router Agent Workflow". When the router agent is configured as a function, this config option allows control of the tool description (for example, when used as a tool within another agent).

* `system_prompt`: Optional. Custom system prompt to use with the agent. Allows override of the default routing instructions.

* `user_prompt`: Optional. Custom user prompt template to use with the agent. Must include variables for input and available branches.

* `max_router_retries`: Defaults to 3. Maximum number of retries if the router agent fails to choose a valid branch.

* `detailed_logs`: Defaults to False. Enable detailed logging to see the routing decisions and branch responses.

* `log_response_max_chars`: Defaults to 1000. Maximum number of characters to display in logs when logging branch responses.

## The Router Agent Workflow
The router agent uses a single-pass graph architecture that analyzes requests and routes them to appropriate branches:

<div align="center">
<img src="../../../_static/router_agent.png" alt="Router Agent Graph Structure" width="400" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

The router agent follows a streamlined two-phase process:

1. **Routing Phase** – The router node analyzes the user request and selects the most appropriate branch based on branch descriptions and request content.
2. **Execution Phase** – The branch node executes the selected branch with the original input and returns the result.

### Example Walkthrough

Imagine a router agent configured with three advisors needs to handle:

> "I want a yellow fruit"

#### Routing Phase
1. **Request Analysis**: The router node receives the input "I want a yellow fruit"
2. **Branch Evaluation**: The agent evaluates available branches:
   - `fruit_advisor`: "Provides recommendations for fruits based on user preferences"
   - `city_advisor`: "Suggests cities to visit based on user interests"
   - `literature_advisor`: "Recommends books and literary works"
3. **Branch Selection**: Based on the request content, the router node selects `fruit_advisor` as the most appropriate branch

#### Execution Phase
1. **Branch Execution**: The branch node calls the `fruit_advisor` function with the original input
2. **Response Generation**: The `fruit_advisor` processes the request and returns "banana"
3. **Result Return**: The router agent returns the final result: "banana"

Since the router agent uses a single-pass architecture, it routes requests without multiple reasoning steps.

## Use Cases

The router agent is well-suited for:

* **Multi-domain Applications**: Route requests to different specialized agents based on topic (such as technical support, sales, or general inquiries)
* **Workflow Orchestration**: Direct different types of tasks to appropriate processing pipelines
* **API Gateway Pattern**: Route API requests to different backend services based on request characteristics
* **Content Classification**: Automatically categorize and route content to appropriate handlers

---

## Limitations

The following are the limitations of router agents:

* **Single Branch Selection**: The router agent selects only one branch per request and does not perform multi-step routing or branch combination.

* **No Inter-branch Communication**: Branches operate independently and cannot communicate with each other within a single request.

* **Routing Accuracy Dependency**: The effectiveness of routing depends on the quality of branch descriptions and the LLM's ability to understand request intent.
