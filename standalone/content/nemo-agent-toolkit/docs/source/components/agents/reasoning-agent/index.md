# About Reasoning Agent

The reasoning [agent](../index.md) is an AI system that uses the NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit core library agents and tools to directly invoke an underlying function while performing reasoning on top. Unlike ReAct agents, it reasons ahead of time through planning rather than between steps. However, an LLM that supports reasoning needs to be chosen for use with a reasoning agent. Additionally, you can customize prompts in your YAML config file for your specific needs. 

To configure your reasoning agent, refer to [Configure the Reasoning Agent](./reasoning-agent.md).
