# Agents

An [agent](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introduction-to-llm-agents/#what_is_an_ai_agent) is a system that can use an [LLM](../../build-workflows/llms/index.md) to reason through a problem, create a plan to solve the problem, and execute the plan with the help of a set of [tools](../../build-workflows/functions-and-function-groups/functions.md#agents-and-tools). Refer to [Introduction to LLM Agents](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introduction-to-llm-agents/) for more details on this. In NeMo Agent Toolkit, agents are implemented as a special type of [function](../../build-workflows/functions-and-function-groups/functions.md) that can orchestrate other functions.

NeMo Agent Toolkit includes several agents out of the box to choose from. In addition to this NeMo Agent Toolkit makes it easy to write a custom agent, for an example of this refer to the Alert Triage example (`examples/advanced_agents/alert_triage_agent`) in the [repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit).

NeMo Agent Toolkit also provides an [Automatic Memory Wrapper](./auto-memory-wrapper/index.md) that enhances any existing agent with automatic memory capture and retrieval capabilities.
