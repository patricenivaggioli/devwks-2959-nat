# Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)

NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit [Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)](https://a2aproject.org/) integration includes:
* An [A2A client](../../build-workflows/a2a-client.md) to connect to and interact with remote A2A [agents](../agents/index.md).
* An [A2A server](../../run-workflows/a2a-server.md) to publish [workflows](../../build-workflows/about-building-workflows.md) as A2A agents that can be discovered and invoked by other A2A clients.

**Note:** A2A functionality requires the `nvidia-nat-a2a` package. Install it with `uv pip install "nvidia-nat[a2a]"`.

## What is A2A?

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol is an open standard from the Linux Foundation that enables agent-to-agent communication and collaboration. A2A standardizes how agents:
- **Discover capabilities** through Agent Cards
- **Delegate tasks** to other agents
- **Exchange information** using a common protocol

## Why Use A2A?

Multiple agents are useful when you want to:

- Group logic by domain or function and keep responsibilities clear.
- Reuse specialized agents without duplicating logic.
- Scale or replace parts of the system independently.

A2A makes multi-agent systems easier to manage by:

- Discovering remote capabilities through Agent Cards.
- Providing a consistent protocol for communication.
- Delegating tasks to specialized agents across different stacks.
- Enabling secure access through A2A authentication when your agents require it.

If you already have a multi-agent use case, A2A provides a standard interface that keeps integrations predictable and easier to maintain. If you are exploring options, A2A is a good fit when you expect to add or swap agents over time.

## Key Concepts

### A2A Agent
A service that exposes capabilities (skills) via the A2A protocol. Agents publish an Agent Card describing their capabilities and accept task requests from clients.

### Agent Card
JSON metadata describing an A2A agent's capabilities, including:
- Agent name, version, and description
- Available skills with descriptions and examples
- Supported capabilities (streaming, push notifications)
- Content types (input/output modes)

### A2A Client
A component that connects to remote A2A agents and invokes their skills. The `a2a_client` [function group](../../build-workflows/functions-and-function-groups/function-groups.md) provides a function interface for interacting with remote agents.

### A2A Server
A service that exposes workflows as A2A agents. The `nat a2a serve` command publishes workflows so they can be discovered and called by other A2A clients.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate A2A integration:

- **Math Assistant A2A** (`examples/A2A/math_assistant_a2a/`) - A2A communication with hybrid [tool](../../build-workflows/functions-and-function-groups/functions.md#agents-and-tools) composition (A2A calculator + MCP time + local logic)
- **Currency Agent A2A** (`examples/A2A/currency_agent_a2a/`) - Connecting to external third-party A2A services (LangGraph-based currency agent)

## Documentation

- [Connecting to Remote Agents](../../build-workflows/a2a-client.md)
- [Publishing Workflows](../../run-workflows/a2a-server.md)
- [A2A Authentication](../auth/a2a-auth.md)

## Protocol Compliance

The A2A integration is built on the official [A2A Python SDK](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-python) to ensure protocol compliance. For detailed protocol specifications, refer to the [A2A Protocol Documentation](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/).

## A2A vs MCP

Both A2A and MCP enable integration with external capabilities, but they serve different purposes:

| Aspect | A2A | MCP |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Purpose** | Agent-to-agent communication | Tool and context integration |
| **Granularity** | Agent level (high-level tasks) | Tool level (specific functions) |
| **Discovery** | Agent Card with skills | Tool list with schemas |
| **Use Case** | Delegating to other agents | Accessing tools and context |
| **Best For** | Multi-agent systems | Tool integration |

You typically use A2A to delegate complex tasks to other agents and MCP to access tools and context. You can use both protocols together for maximum flexibility.
