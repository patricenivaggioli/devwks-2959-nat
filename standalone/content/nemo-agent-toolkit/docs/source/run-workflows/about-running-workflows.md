# About Running NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit Workflows

A [workflow](../build-workflows/about-building-workflows.md) is defined by a YAML configuration file that specifies the [tools](../build-workflows/functions-and-function-groups/functions.md#agents-and-tools) and models to use. NeMo Agent Toolkit provides the following ways to run a workflow:
- [Using the `nat run` command](#using-the-nat-run-command).
   - This is the simplest and most common way to run a workflow.
- [Using the `nat serve` command](#using-the-nat-serve-command).
   - This starts a web server that listens for incoming requests and runs the specified workflow.
- [Using the `nat mcp serve` command](#using-the-nat-mcp-serve-command).
   - This starts a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that publishes the [functions](../build-workflows/functions-and-function-groups/functions.md) from your workflow as MCP tools.
- [Using the `nat eval` command](#using-the-nat-eval-command).
   - In addition to running the workflow, it also [evaluates](../improve-workflows/evaluate.md) the accuracy of the workflow.
- [Using the Python API](#using-the-python-api).
   - This is the most flexible way to run a workflow.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have followed the instructions in the [Install Guide](../get-started/installation.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent Toolkit.

The examples in this document utilize the `examples/getting_started/simple_web_query` workflow, install it by running the following commands from the root directory of the NeMo Agent Toolkit library:
```bash
uv pip install -e examples/getting_started/simple_web_query
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../get-started/quick-start.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```


## Using the `nat run` Command
The `nat run` command is the simplest way to run a workflow. `nat run` receives a configuration file as specified by the `--config_file` flag, along with input that can be specified either directly with the `--input` flag or by providing a file path with the `--input_file` flag.

A typical invocation of the `nat run` command follows this pattern:
```
nat run --config_file <path/to/config.yml> [--input "question?" | --input_file <path/to/input.txt>]
```

Where `--input_file` accepts a plain text file containing a single input string.

The following command runs the `examples/getting_started/simple_web_query` workflow with a single input question "What is LangSmith?":
```bash
nat run --config_file examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml --input "What is LangSmith?"
```

The following command runs the same workflow with the input question provided in a plain text file. The `--input_file` option is intended for single (typically verbose) inputs that are better stored in a file than passed on the command line:
```bash
echo "What is LangSmith?" > .tmp/input.txt
nat run --config_file examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml --input_file .tmp/input.txt
```

:::{note}
The `--input_file` option accepts a plain text file containing a single input, not an array of inputs. For batch evaluation of multiple inputs, use `nat eval` instead.
:::

## Using the `nat serve` Command
The `nat serve` command starts a web server that listens for incoming requests and runs the specified workflow. The server can be accessed with a web browser or by sending a POST request to the server's endpoint. Similar to the `nat run` command, the `nat serve` command requires a configuration file specified by the `--config_file` flag.

The following command runs the `examples/getting_started/simple_web_query` workflow on a web server listening to the default port `8000` and default endpoint of `/generate`:
```bash
nat serve --config_file examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml
```

In a separate terminal, run the following command to send a POST request to the server:
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/generate \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "input_message": "What is LangSmith?"
}'
```

Refer to `nat serve --help` for more information on how to customize the server.

## Using the `nat mcp serve` Command
The `nat mcp serve` command starts a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that publishes the functions from your workflow as MCP tools. This allows other MCP clients to connect to the server and use the published tools.

The following command runs the `examples/getting_started/simple_web_query` workflow as an MCP server listening on the default port `9901`:
```bash
nat mcp serve --config_file examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml
```

In a separate terminal, you can use the `nat mcp client` command to inspect and interact with the MCP server.

To list the available tools on the MCP server, run the following command:
```bash
nat mcp client tool list
```
The above command defaults to the default MCP server URL of `http://localhost:9901/mcp`, if your MCP server is running on a different URL, you can specify it with the ` --url` flag.

To inspect a specific tool, run the following command:
```bash
nat mcp client tool list --tool react_agent
```

To invoke a tool on the MCP server, run the following command:
```bash
nat mcp client tool call react_agent --json-args '{"query": "What is LangSmith?"}'
```

Refer to [MCP Server](./mcp-server.md) for more information on the NeMo Agent Toolkit MCP server.

## Using the `nat eval` Command
The `nat eval` command is similar to the `nat run` command. However, in addition to running the workflow, it also evaluates the accuracy of the workflow, refer to [Evaluating NeMo Agent Toolkit Workflows](../improve-workflows/evaluate.md) for more information.

## Using the Python API

The toolkit offers a programmatic way to execute workflows through its Python API, allowing you to integrate workflow execution directly into your Python code. Here's how to use it:

```python
import asyncio

from nat.utils import run_workflow

result = asyncio.run(
    run_workflow(config_file='examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml',
                 prompt='What is LangSmith?'))

print(result)
```

Refer to the Python API documentation for the {py:func}`~nat.utils.run_workflow` function for detailed information about its capabilities.
