# Observing a Workflow with DBNL

This guide provides a step-by-step process to enable observability in a NeMo Agent Toolkit workflow using DBNL for tracing. By the end of this guide, you will have:

- Configured telemetry in your workflow.
- Ability to view traces in the DBNL platform.

## Step 1: Install DBNL

Visit [https://docs.dbnl.com/get-started/quickstart](https://docs.dbnl.com/get-started/quickstart) to install DBNL.

## Step 2: Create a Project

Create a new Trace Ingestion project in DBNL. To create a new project in DBNL:

1. Navigate to your DBNL deployment (e.g. <http://localhost:8080/>)
2. Go to Projects > + New Project
3. Name your project `nat-calculator`
4. Add a LLM connection to your project
5. Select Trace Ingestion as the project Data Source
6. Click on Generate API Token and note down the generated **API Token**
7. Note down the **Project Id** for the project

## Step 3: Configure Your Environment

Set the following environment variables in your terminal:

```bash
# DBNL_API_URL should point to your deployment API URL (e.g. http://localhost:8080/api)
export DBNL_API_URL=<your_api_url>
export DBNL_API_TOKEN=<your_api_token>
export DBNL_PROJECT_ID=<your_project_id>
```

## Step 4: Install the NeMo Agent Toolkit OpenTelemetry Subpackages

```bash
# Install specific telemetry extras required for DBNL
uv pip install -e '.[opentelemetry]'
```

## Step 5: Modify NeMo Agent Toolkit Workflow Configuration

Update your workflow configuration file to include the telemetry settings.

Example configuration:
```yaml
general:
  telemetry:
    tracing:
      dbnl:
        _type: dbnl
```

## Step 6: Run the workflow

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent Toolkit library, install dependencies and run the pre-configured `simple_calculator_observability` example.

**Example:**

```bash
# Install the workflow and plugins
uv pip install -e examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/

# Run the workflow with DBNL telemetry settings
# Note: you may have to update configuration settings based on your DBNL deployment
nat run --config_file examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/configs/config-dbnl.yml --input "What is 1*2?"
```

As the workflow runs, telemetry data will start showing up in DBNL.

## Step 7: Analyze Traces Data in DBNL

Analyze the traces in DBNL. To analyze traces in DBNL:

1. Navigate to your DBNL deployment (e.g. http://localhost:8080/)
2. Go to Projects > `nat-calculator`

For additional help, see the [DBNL docs](https://docs.dbnl.com/).
