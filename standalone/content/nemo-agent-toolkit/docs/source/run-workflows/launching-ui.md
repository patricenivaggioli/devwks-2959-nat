# Launch the NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit API Server and User Interface

NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit provides a user interface for interacting with your running [workflow](../build-workflows/about-building-workflows.md). This guide walks you through starting the API server and launching the web-based user interface to interact with your workflows.

## User Interface Features

- Modern and responsive user interface
- Real-time streaming responses
- Human-in-the-loop workflow support
- Chat history and conversation management
- Light and Dark theme support
- WebSocket and HTTP API integration
- Intermediate steps visualization
- Docker deployment support

## Walk-through

This walk-through guides you through the steps to set up and configure the NeMo Agent Toolkit user interface.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- NeMo Agent Toolkit installed and configured
- Set up the simple calculator workflow by following the instructions in `examples/getting_started/simple_calculator/README.md`
- Node.js v18+ installed (required for the web interface)

The NeMo Agent Toolkit UI is located in a Git submodule at `external/nat-ui`. Ensure you have checked out all of the Git submodules by running the following:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Start the NeMo Agent Toolkit Server

You can start the NeMo Agent Toolkit server using the `nat serve` command with the appropriate configuration file.

```bash
nat serve --config_file=examples/getting_started/simple_calculator/configs/config.yml
```

Running this command will produce the expected output as shown below (truncated for brevity):

```bash
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### Verify the NeMo Agent Toolkit Server is Running

After the server is running, you can make HTTP requests to interact with the workflow. This step confirms that the server is properly configured and can process requests.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/generate \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "input_message": "Is 4 + 4 greater than the current hour of the day?"
}'
```

Running this command will produce the following expected output:

:::note
The response depends on the current time of day that the command is run.
:::

```bash
{
  "value": "No, 8 is less than the current hour of the day (4)."
}
```

### Launch the NeMo Agent Toolkit User Interface

After the NeMo Agent Toolkit server starts, launch the web user interface. Launching the UI requires that Node.js v18+ is installed. Instructions for downloading and installing Node.js can be found in the official [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

For comprehensive information about the NeMo Agent Toolkit UI, including setup instructions, configuration options, and UI components documentation, see:

- [NeMo Agent Toolkit UI README](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit-UI/blob/main/README.md) - Complete UI documentation and setup guide
- [UI Components Documentation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit-UI/tree/main/docs/ui) - Detailed information about components, features, and interface elements

#### Local Development

```bash
cd external/nat-ui
npm ci
npm run dev
```

After the web development server starts, open a web browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/).

:::{important}
Workflows requiring human input or interaction (such as human-in-the-loop workflows, OAuth authentication, or interactive prompts) must use WebSocket connections. HTTP requests are the default method of communication, but human-in-the-loop functionality is not supported through HTTP.
:::

To enable WebSocket mode:

1. Open the panel on the top right of the webpage
2. Toggle the **WebSocket** button to ON
3. You will see a notification that says "websocket connected" when successfully connected

### Connect the User Interface to the NeMo Agent Toolkit Server Using HTTP API

Configure the settings by selecting the *Settings* icon located on the bottom left corner of the home page.

![NeMo Agent Toolkit Web UI Settings](../_static/ui_settings_example.png)

#### Settings Options

**Appearance:**

- `Theme`: Switch between Light and Dark mode

**API Configuration:**

- `HTTP Endpoint`: Select API endpoint type:
  - **Chat Completions — Streaming** - Real-time OpenAI Chat Completions compatible API endpoint with streaming responses (recommended for intermediate results)
  - **Chat Completions — Non-Streaming** - Standard OpenAI Chat Completions compatible API endpoint
  - **Generate — Streaming** - Text generation with streaming
  - **Generate — Non-Streaming** - Standard text generation
- `Optional Generation Parameters`: OpenAI Chat Completions compatible JSON parameters that can be added to the request body (available for chat endpoints)

**WebSocket Configuration:**

The WebSocket path defaults to `websocket`.

- `WebSocket Schema`: Select schema for real-time connections:
  - **Chat Completions — Streaming** - Streaming chat over WebSocket (recommended for intermediate results)
  - **Chat Completions — Non-Streaming** - Non-streaming chat over WebSocket
  - **Generate — Streaming** - Streaming generation over WebSocket
  - **Generate — Non-Streaming** - Non-streaming generation over WebSocket

:::note
For intermediate results streaming, use **Chat Completions — Streaming** or **Generate — Streaming**.

### Simple Calculator Example Conversation

Interact with the chat interface by prompting the Agent with the
message: `Is 4 + 4 greater than the current hour of the day?`
