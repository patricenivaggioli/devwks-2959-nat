# About Improving NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit Workflows

NeMo Agent Toolkit offers a variety of [tools](../build-workflows/functions-and-function-groups/functions.md#agents-and-tools) and techniques to improve [workflows](../build-workflows/about-building-workflows.md). This section provides guides on evaluating, profiling, optimizing, and scaling your workflows for better performance and efficiency.

- [Evaluating Workflows](./evaluate.md) - Validate and maintain accuracy of agentic workflows with built-in evaluation tools.
- [Profiling and Performance Monitoring](./profiler.md) - Use the profiler to profile entire workflows down to the [tool](../build-workflows/functions-and-function-groups/functions.md#agents-and-tools) and [agent](../components/agents/index.md) level, track input/output tokens and timings, and identify bottlenecks.
- [Optimizer Guide](./optimizer.md) - Automatically tune the parameters and prompts of your agents, tools, and workflows to maximize performance, minimize cost, and increase accuracy.
- [Sizing Calculator](./sizing-calc.md) - Using the sizing calculator to estimate GPU cluster size requirements.
- [Test Time Compute](./test-time-compute.md) - Use composable pre-built or customizable strategies to scale agent execution at runtime and improve performance.
- [Finetuning Harness](./finetuning/index.md) - Leverage the finetuning harness for finetuning of agentic [LLM](../build-workflows/llms/index.md) workflows to iteratively improve agents through experience.
