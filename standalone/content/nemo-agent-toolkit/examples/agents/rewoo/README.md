# ReWOO Agent Example

**Complexity:** 🟢 Beginner

This example demonstrates how to use a configurable [ReWOO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18323) (Reasoning WithOut Observation) agent with the NeMo Agent Toolkit. For this purpose NeMo Agent Toolkit provides a [`rewoo_agent`](../../../docs/source/components/agents/rewoo-agent/index.md) workflow type.

## Key Features

- **ReWOO Agent Architecture:** Demonstrates the unique `rewoo_agent` workflow type that implements Reasoning Without Observation, separating planning, execution, and solving into distinct phases.
- **Three-Node Graph Structure:** Uses a distinctive architecture with Planner Node (creates complete execution plan), Executor Node (executes tools systematically), and Solver Node (synthesizes final results).
- **Systematic Tool Execution:** Shows how ReWOO first plans all necessary steps upfront, then executes them systematically without dynamic re-planning, leading to more predictable tool usage patterns.
- **Calculator and Internet Search Integration:** Includes `calculator` and `internet_search` tools to demonstrate multi-step reasoning that requires both mathematical computation and web research.
- **Plan-Execute-Solve Pattern:** Demonstrates the ReWOO approach of complete upfront planning followed by systematic execution and final result synthesis.

## Graph Structure

The ReWOO agent uses a unique three-node graph architecture that separates planning, execution, and solving into distinct phases. The following diagram illustrates the agent's workflow:

<div align="center">
<img src="../../../docs/source/_static/rewoo_agent.png" alt="ReWOO Agent Graph Structure" width="400" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

**Workflow Overview:**
- **Start**: The agent begins processing with user input
- **Planner Node**: Creates a complete execution plan with all necessary steps upfront. Plans are parsed into a Dependency Graph for parallel execution. 
- **Executor Node**: Executes tools according to the plan. Non-dependent tool calls are executed in parallel at each level.
- **Solver Node**: Takes all execution results and generates the final answer
- **End**: Process completes with the final response

This architecture differs from other agents by separating reasoning (planning) from execution, allowing for more systematic and predictable tool usage patterns. The ReWOO approach first plans all steps, then executes them systematically, and finally synthesizes the results.

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/get-started/installation.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent Toolkit.

### Install this Workflow

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent Toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/agents
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/get-started/quick-start.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

Prior to using the `tavily_internet_search` tool, create an account at [`tavily.com``](https://tavily.com/) and obtain an API key. Once obtained, set the `TAVILY_API_KEY` environment variable to the API key:
```bash
export TAVILY_API_KEY=<YOUR_TAVILY_API_KEY>
```

## Configuration

The ReWOO agent is configured through the `config.yml` file. The following configuration options are available:

### Configurable Options

* `tool_names`: A list of tools that the agent can call. The tools must be functions or function groups configured in the YAML file

* `llm_name`: The LLM the agent should use. The LLM must be configured in the YAML file

* `verbose`: Defaults to False (useful to prevent logging of sensitive data). If set to True, the agent will log input, output, and intermediate steps.

* `include_tool_input_schema_in_tool_description`: Defaults to True. If set to True, the agent will include tool input schemas in tool descriptions.

* `description`: Defaults to "ReWOO Agent Workflow". When the ReWOO agent is configured as a function, this config option allows us to control the tool description (for example, when used as a tool within another agent).

* `planner_prompt`: Optional. Allows us to override the planner prompt for the ReWOO agent. The prompt must have variables for tools and must instruct the LLM to output in the ReWOO planner format.

* `solver_prompt`: Optional. Allows us to override the solver prompt for the ReWOO agent. The prompt must have variables for plan and task.

* `tool_call_max_retries`: Defaults to 3. The number of retries before raising a tool call error.

* `max_history`:  Defaults to 15. Maximum number of messages to keep in the conversation history.

* `log_response_max_chars`: Defaults to 1000. Maximum number of characters to display in logs when logging tool responses.

* `additional_planner_instructions`: Optional. Defaults to `None`. Additional instructions to provide to the agent in addition to the base planner prompt.

* `additional_solver_instructions`: Optional. Defaults to `None`. Additional instructions to provide to the agent in addition to the base solver prompt.

* `raise_tool_call_error`: Defaults to True. Whether to raise a exception immediately if a tool call fails. If set to False, the tool call error message will be included in the tool response and passed to the next tool.

## Run the Workflow

Run the following command from the root of the NeMo Agent Toolkit repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
nat run --config_file=examples/agents/rewoo/configs/config.yml --input "Who would be older today, Einstein or Bohr?"
```

**Expected Workflow Output**
```console
