# Tool Calling Agent

**Complexity:** 🟢 Beginner

A configurable Tool Calling agent. This agent leverages the NeMo Agent Toolkit plugin system and `WorkflowBuilder` to integrate pre-built and custom tools into the workflow. Key elements are summarized below:

- [Using Tool Calling with the OpenAI Responses API](#using-tool-calling-with-the-openai-responses-api)

## Key Features

- **Tool Calling Agent Framework:** Demonstrates a `tool_calling_agent` that leverages tool or function input schemas to make precise tool selections and structured function calls.
- **Wikipedia Search Integration:** Shows integration with the `wikipedia_search` tool for retrieving factual information from Wikipedia sources.
- **Code Generation Capabilities:** Includes the `code_generation_tool` for generating code examples and technical content.
- **Schema-Driven Tool Selection:** Uses structured input schemas to appropriately route to the correct tool, providing more deterministic tool calling compared to name or description-based routing.
- **Dual-Node Graph Architecture:** Implements the same operational pattern as other NeMo Agent Toolkit agents, alternating between reasoning and tool execution while using schema-based tool selection.

## Graph Structure

The Tool Calling agent uses the same dual-node graph architecture as other agents in the NeMo Agent Toolkit, alternating between reasoning and tool execution. The following diagram illustrates the agent's workflow:

<div align="center">
<img src="../../../docs/source/_static/dual_node_agent.png" alt="Tool Calling Agent Graph Structure" width="400" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

**Workflow Overview:**
- **Start**: The agent begins processing with user input
- **Agent Node**: Leverages tool or function input schemas to decide which tool to call or provide a final answer
- **Conditional Edge**: Routes the flow based on the agent's decision
- **Tool Node**: Executes the selected tool using structured input schemas
- **Cycle**: The agent can loop between reasoning and tool execution until it reaches a final answer

This architecture enables the Tool Calling agent to make precise tool selections based on input schemas while maintaining the same operational pattern as other agents in the NeMo Agent Toolkit.

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/get-started/installation.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent Toolkit.

### Install this Workflow

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent Toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

The `code_generation` and `wiki_search` tools are part of the `nvidia-nat[langchain]` package.  To install the package run the following command:
```bash
# local package install from source
uv pip install -e '.[langchain]'
```


### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/get-started/quick-start.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

If you will be using the Responses API, also export your model's API key as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` as shown below. 

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
```

---

## Run the Workflow

The Tool Calling Agent can be used as either a workflow or a function, and there's an example configuration that demonstrates both.
If you’re looking for an example workflow where the Tool Calling Agent runs as the main workflow, refer to [config.yml](configs/config.yml).
To see the Tool Calling Agent used as a function within a workflow, alongside the Reasoning Agent, refer to [config-reasoning.yml](configs/config-reasoning.yml).
This README primarily covers the former case, where the Tool Calling Agent functions as the main workflow, in config.yml.
For more details, refer to the [Tool Calling Agent documentation](../../../docs/source/components/agents/tool-calling-agent/index.md) and the [React Agent documentation](../../../docs/source/components/agents/react-agent/index.md)

Run the following command from the root of the NeMo Agent Toolkit repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
nat run --config_file=examples/agents/tool_calling/configs/config.yml --input "who was Djikstra?"
```

**Expected Workflow Output**

> [!NOTE]
> The output from `wikipedia_search` tool may contain odd formatting (extra newlines, additional indentation), especially when a Wikipedia page contains formula or other complex content. This is expected due to the upstream behavior of the `wikipedia` python package.

### Starting the NeMo Agent Toolkit Server

You can start the NeMo Agent Toolkit server using the `nat serve` command with the appropriate configuration file.

**Starting the Tool Calling Agent Example Workflow**

```bash
nat serve --config_file=examples/agents/tool_calling/configs/config.yml
```

### Making Requests to the NeMo Agent Toolkit Server

Once the server is running, you can make HTTP requests to interact with the workflow.

#### Non-Streaming Requests

**Non-Streaming Request to the Tool Calling Agent Workflow**

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/generate \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are LLMs?"}]}'
```

#### Streaming Requests

**Streaming Request to the Tool Calling Agent Workflow**

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/generate/stream \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are LLMs?"}]}'
```
---
### Evaluating the Tool Calling Agent Workflow
**Run and evaluate the `tool_calling_agent` example Workflow**

```bash
nat eval --config_file=examples/agents/tool_calling/configs/config.yml
```

### Using Tool Calling with the OpenAI Responses API
The NeMo Agent Toolkit also provides an agent implementation that uses OpenAI's Responses API to enable built-in tools (such as Code Interpreter) and remote tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP).

#### What is the Responses API?
OpenAI's Responses API is a unified endpoint for reasoning models that supports built-in tools and external tool integrations. Compared to Chat Completions, Responses focuses on agentic behaviors like multi-step tool use, background tasks, and streaming of intermediate items. With Responses, models can:
- Use built-in tools such as Code Interpreter; some models also support file search and image generation.
- Connect to remote tools exposed over the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

For current capabilities and model support, see OpenAI's documentation for the Responses API.

#### Run the Responses API agent
An example configuration is provided at `examples/agents/tool_calling/configs/config-responses-api.yml`. Run it from the NeMo Agent Toolkit repo root:

```bash
nat run --config_file=examples/agents/tool_calling/configs/config-responses-api.yml --input "How many 0s are in the current time?"
```

#### Configure the agent for Responses
Key fields in `config-responses-api.yml`:

```yaml
llms:
  openai_llm:
    _type: openai
    model_name: gpt-5-mini
    # Setting the `api_type` to responses uses the Responses API
    api_type: responses

workflow:
  _type: responses_api_agent
  llm_name: openai_llm
  verbose: true
  handle_tool_errors: true
  # Tools exposed to the agent:
  nat_tools: [current_datetime]     # NAT tools executed by the agent graph
  builtin_tools:                    # Built-in OpenAI tools bound directly to the LLM
    - type: code_interpreter
      container:
        type: "auto"
  mcp_tools: []                     # Optional: remote tools over MCP (see below)
```

- **`nat_tools`**: Tools implemented in NeMo Agent Toolkit (for example, `current_datetime`). These run via the tool node in the agent graph.
- **`builtin_tools`**: Tools provided by OpenAI's Responses API and executed by the model runtime. The agent binds them to the LLM; the graph does not run them directly.
- **`mcp_tools`**: Remote tools exposed via MCP. The agent passes the schema to the LLM; the model orchestrates calls to the remote server.

#### Built-in tools for OpenAI models
Built-in tool availability depends on model and account features. Common built-ins include:
- **Code Interpreter**: Execute Python for data analysis, math, and code execution. In this repo, configure it as:
  ```yaml
  builtin_tools:
    - type: code_interpreter
      container:
        type: "auto"
  ```
- **File search** and **image generation** may be supported by some models in Responses. Refer to OpenAI docs for the latest tool names and required parameters if you choose to add them to `builtin_tools`.

Notes:
- This agent enforces that the selected LLM uses the Responses API.
- When `builtin_tools` or `mcp_tools` are provided, they are bound on the LLM with `strict=True` and optional `parallel_tool_calls` support.

#### Configure MCP tools
You can allow the model to call tools from a remote MCP server by adding entries under `mcp_tools`. The schema is defined in `packages/nvidia_nat_core/src/nat/data_models/openai_mcp.py`.

Example:

```yaml
workflow:
  _type: responses_api_agent
  llm_name: openai_llm
  # ...
  mcp_tools:
    - type: mcp
      server_label: deepwiki
      server_url: https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp
      allowed_tools: [read_wiki_structure, read_wiki_contents]
      require_approval: never   # one of: never, always, auto
      headers:
        Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN_IF_REQUIRED>
```

Field reference (MCP):
- **type**: Must be `mcp`.
- **`server_label`**: A short label for the server. Used in model outputs and logs.
- **`server_url`**: The MCP server endpoint URL.
- **`allowed_tools`**: Optional allowlist of tool names the model may call. Omit or set empty to allow all server tools.
- **`require_approval`**: `never`, `always`, or `auto` (defaults to `never`). Controls whether tool invocations require approval.
- **headers**: Optional HTTP headers to include on MCP requests.

#### Tips and troubleshooting
- Ensure your model supports the specific built-in tools you enable.
- Some built-ins (for example, file search) may require separate setup in your OpenAI account (vector stores, file uploads). Consult OpenAI documentation for current requirements.
- If tool calls error and `handle_tool_errors` is `true`, the agent will surface an informative message instead of raising.
