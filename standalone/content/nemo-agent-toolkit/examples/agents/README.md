# Agent Examples

The agent examples demonstrate how NeMo Agent Toolkit accelerates and enables AI Agent development.
The examples showcase 5 distinct AI Agent architectures solving a similar problem in different ways.
By leveraging the NeMo Agent Toolkit plugin system and the `Builder` object, you can use both pre-built and
custom agentic workflows and tools in a flexible manner.

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../docs/source/get-started/installation.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent Toolkit.

### Set Up API Keys

If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../docs/source/get-started/quick-start.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Example Usage

Each agent example contains its own installation and usage instructions. Navigate to the specific example directory and follow the README instructions:

- **ReAct Agent**: See [react/README.md](react/README.md) for step-by-step reasoning agent implementation
- **Tool Calling Agent**: See [tool_calling/README.md](tool_calling/README.md) for direct tool invocation agent
- **Mixture of Agents**: See [mixture_of_agents/README.md](mixture_of_agents/README.md) for multi-agent orchestration
- **ReWOO Agent**: See [rewoo/README.md](rewoo/README.md) for planning-based agent workflow
- **Auto Memory Wrapper Agent**: See [auto_memory_wrapper/README.md](auto_memory_wrapper/README.md) for the automatic memory wrapper agent workflow
