- **Multi-Model Performance Testing:** Shows systematic comparison across different LLM providers including OpenAI models, NVIDIA Nemotron models, Llama 3.1, and Llama 3.3 to identify optimal configurations for documentation retrieval tasks.
- **Evaluation Framework Integration:** Uses the NeMo Agent Toolkit `nat eval` command with various evaluation configurations to measure response quality, accuracy scores, and documentation retrieval effectiveness.
- **Question-by-Question Analysis:** Provides detailed breakdown of individual agent responses with comprehensive metrics for identifying failure patterns in LangSmith documentation queries.
- **Dataset Management Workflow:** Demonstrates working with evaluation datasets for consistent testing and performance tracking over time, including evaluation-only modes and result upload capabilities.

## What You'll Learn

- **Accuracy Evaluation**: Measure and validate agent responses using various evaluation methods
- **Performance Analysis**: Understand agent behavior through systematic evaluation
- **Multi-Model Testing**: Compare performance across different LLM providers (OpenAI, NVIDIA Nemotron, Llama 3.1, Llama 3.3)
- **Dataset Management**: Work with evaluation datasets for consistent testing

## Prerequisites

1. **Agent toolkit**: Ensure you have the Agent toolkit installed. If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/get-started/installation.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent Toolkit.
2. **Base workflow**: This example builds upon the Getting Started [Simple Web Query](../../getting_started/simple_web_query/) example. Make sure you are familiar with the example before proceeding.

## Installation and Setup

### Install this Workflow

Install this evaluation example:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/evaluation_and_profiling/simple_web_query_eval
```

### Set Up API Keys

Follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/get-started/quick-start.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to set up your API keys:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>  # For OpenAI evaluations
```

## Run the Workflow

### Running Evaluation

Evaluate the Simple LangSmith-Documentation agent's accuracy using different configurations:

#### Basic Evaluation

The configuration files specified below contain configurations for the NeMo Agent Toolkit `evaluation` and `profiler` capabilities. For detailed information about evaluation configuration and output files, refer to the [evaluation guide](../../../docs/source/improve-workflows/evaluate.md). For profiling configuration and metrics, refer to the [profiling guide](../../../docs/source/improve-workflows/profiler.md).

```bash
nat eval --config_file examples/evaluation_and_profiling/simple_web_query_eval/configs/eval_config.yml
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter rate limiting (`[429] Too Many Requests`) during evaluation, try setting the `eval.general.max_concurrency` value either in the YAML directly or via the command line with: `--override eval.general.max_concurrency 1`.

#### OpenAI Model Evaluation
```bash
nat eval --config_file examples/evaluation_and_profiling/simple_web_query_eval/configs/eval_config_openai.yml
```

#### Llama 3.1 Model Evaluation
```bash
nat eval --config_file examples/evaluation_and_profiling/simple_web_query_eval/configs/eval_config_llama31.yml
```

#### Llama 3.3 Model Evaluation
```bash
nat eval --config_file examples/evaluation_and_profiling/simple_web_query_eval/configs/eval_config_llama33.yml
```

#### Evaluation-Only Mode
```bash
nat eval --skip_workflow --config_file examples/evaluation_and_profiling/simple_web_query_eval/configs/eval_only_config.yml --dataset ./.tmp/nat/examples/evaluation_and_profiling/simple_web_query_eval/eval/workflow_output.json
```


#### Evaluation with Upload

##### Setting up S3 Bucket for Upload

To enable the `eval_upload.yml` workflow, you must configure an S3-compatible bucket for both dataset input and result output. You can use AWS S3, MinIO, or another S3-compatible service.

We recommend installing the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) to create and manage your S3 buckets, regardless of the S3-compatible service you use.

**Set the bucket name:**

```bash
export S3_BUCKET_NAME=nat-simple-bucket
```

**Using AWS S3**
1. Configure your AWS credentials:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<your-region>
   ```

**Using MinIO**
1. Start a local MinIO server or cloud instance. To start a local MinIO server, consult the [MinIO section](../../deploy/README.md#running-services) of the deployment guide.
2. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioadmin
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
   export S3_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:9000
   ```

**Creating the S3 bucket:**
```bash
aws s3 mb \
  s3://${S3_BUCKET_NAME}
  ${S3_ENDPOINT_URL:+--endpoint-url=${S3_ENDPOINT_URL}}
```

For more information about using remote files for evaluation, refer to the [evaluation guide](../../../docs/source/improve-workflows/evaluate.md).

##### Upload dataset to the S3 bucket
To use the sample config file `eval_upload.yml`, you need to upload the following dataset files to the S3 bucket at path `input/`:
- `examples/evaluation_and_profiling/simple_web_query_eval/data/langsmith.json`

For example, if you have the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) installed, you can use the following command to upload the dataset files to the S3 bucket:
```bash
aws s3 cp \
  examples/evaluation_and_profiling/simple_web_query_eval/data/langsmith.json \
  s3://${S3_BUCKET_NAME}/input/langsmith.json \
  ${S3_ENDPOINT_URL:+--endpoint-url=${S3_ENDPOINT_URL}}
```

##### Running Evaluation
```bash
nat eval --config_file examples/evaluation_and_profiling/simple_web_query_eval/configs/eval_upload.yml
```

### Understanding Results

After running evaluation, you'll find output files in `./.tmp/nat/examples/evaluation_and_profiling/simple_web_query_eval/eval/` (or your configured output directory). The evaluation generates comprehensive metrics including:

- **Response Quality**: Measures how well the agent answers LangSmith-related questions
- **Accuracy Scores**: Quantitative measures of response correctness
- **Question-by-Question Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of individual responses
- **Performance Metrics**: Overall quality assessments across different models
- **Error Analysis**: Identification of common failure patterns in documentation retrieval and response generation

#### Evaluation Outputs

Running `nat eval` generates several artifacts in the output directory:

**Workflow outputs (always available)**
- `workflow_output.json`: Per-sample execution results including question, expected answer, generated answer, and intermediate steps

**Evaluator outputs (when configured)**
- `trajectory_accuracy_output.json`: Trajectory evaluator scores and reasoning
- `accuracy_output.json`: Ragas AnswerAccuracy scores
- `groundedness_output.json`: Ragas ResponseGroundedness scores
- `relevance_output.json`: Ragas ContextRelevance scores

**Profiler outputs (when enabled)**
- `standardized_data_all.csv`: Per-request profiler metrics
- `workflow_profiling_metrics.json`: Aggregated profiler statistics
- `workflow_profiling_report.txt`: Human-readable profiler summary
- `gantt_chart.png`: Timeline visualization
- `all_requests_profiler_traces.json`: Full trace events
- `inference_optimization.json`: Inference optimization signals (when `compute_llm_metrics` is enabled)

For detailed descriptions of each output file, refer to the [Evaluation outputs section](../../../docs/source/improve-workflows/evaluate.md#evaluation-outputs-what-you-will-get) in the evaluation guide.

### Available Configurations

| Configuration | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `eval_config.yml` | Standard evaluation with NVIDIA Nemotron models (default) |
| `eval_config_openai.yml` | Evaluation using OpenAI models |
| `eval_config_llama31.yml` | Evaluation using Llama 3.1 model |
| `eval_config_llama33.yml` | Evaluation using Llama 3.3 model |
| `eval_only_config.yml` | Evaluation-only mode without running the workflow |
| `eval_upload.yml` | Evaluation with automatic result upload |

This helps you systematically improve your LangSmith documentation agent by understanding its strengths and areas for improvement across different model configurations.
