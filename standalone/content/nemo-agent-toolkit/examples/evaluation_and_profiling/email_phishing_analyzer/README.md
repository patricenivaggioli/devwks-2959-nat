Tool's response:
{"is_likely_phishing": true, "explanation": "The email exhibits suspicious signals that may indicate phishing. Specifically, the email requests sensitive personal information (account and routing numbers) under the guise of completing a refund transaction. Legitimate companies typically do not request such information via email, as it is a security risk. Additionally, the refund amount of '0' is unusual and may be an attempt to create a sense of urgency or confusion. The tone of the email is also somewhat generic and lacks personalization, which is another common trait of phishing emails."}

## Optimization

This example includes an optimization configuration that uses the NeMo Agent Toolkit Optimizer to tune the workflow. For detailed information 
about the NeMo Agent Toolkit Optimizer, refer to the [Optimizer Documentation](../../../docs/source/improve-workflows/optimizer.md).

### What Is Being Optimized
- **Tool parameters**: The `email_phishing_analyzer` exposes one optimizable field in its config:
  - **`prompt`**: The prompt template used to analyze the email body (prompt optimization is disabled by default in this config; see below to enable).
- **LLM hyperparameters**: For each LLM in `llms`, numeric hyperparameters are marked as optimizable:
  - **`temperature`**, **`top_p`**, **`max_tokens`**, and **`model_name`**.

Evaluation during optimization uses the dataset at `examples/evaluation_and_profiling/email_phishing_analyzer/data/smaller_test.csv` with `body` as the question and `label` as the ground truth.

### Optimization Configuration
The optimization-ready configuration is located at:
`examples/evaluation_and_profiling/email_phishing_analyzer/configs/config_optimizer.yml`

Key parts of the config:

```yaml
functions:
  email_phishing_analyzer:
    _type: email_phishing_analyzer
    llm: phishing_llm
    optimizable_params:
      - prompt
  
  # Prompt optimization functions are defined here
  prompt_init:
    _type: prompt_init
    optimizer_llm: prompt_optimizer
    system_objective: Agent that triages an email to see if it is a phishing attempt or not.
  
  prompt_recombination:
    _type: prompt_recombiner
    optimizer_llm: prompt_optimizer
    system_objective: Agent that triages an email to see if it is a phishing attempt or not.

llms:
  phishing_llm:
    _type: nim
    model_name: meta/llama-3.1-405b-instruct
    temperature: 0.0
    max_tokens: 1024
    optimizable_params:
      - temperature
      - top_p
      - max_tokens
      - model_name
    search_space:
      model_name:
        values:
          - meta/llama-3.1-405b-instruct
          - meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct
    
eval:
  general:
    output_dir: ./.tmp/eval/examples/evaluation_and_profiling/email_phishing_analyzer/original
    verbose: true
    dataset:
      _type: csv
      file_path: examples/evaluation_and_profiling/email_phishing_analyzer/data/smaller_test.csv
      id_key: "subject"
      structure:
        question_key: body
        answer_key: label

  evaluators:
    accuracy:
      _type: ragas
      metric: AnswerAccuracy
      llm_name: prompt_optimizer
    groundedness:
      _type: ragas
      metric: ResponseGroundedness
      llm_name: prompt_optimizer
    llm_latency:
      _type: avg_llm_latency
    token_efficiency:
      _type: avg_tokens_per_llm_end

optimizer:
  output_path: ./.tmp/examples/evaluation_and_profiling/email_phishing_analyzer/optimizer/
  reps_per_param_set: 1
  eval_metrics:
    accuracy:
      evaluator_name: accuracy
      direction: maximize
    groundedness:
      evaluator_name: groundedness
      direction: maximize
    token_efficiency:
      evaluator_name: token_efficiency
      direction: minimize
    latency:
      evaluator_name: llm_latency
      direction: minimize

  numeric:
    enabled: true
    n_trials: 3

  prompt:
    enabled: true
    prompt_population_init_function: prompt_init
    prompt_recombination_function: prompt_recombination
    ga_generations: 3
    ga_population_size: 3
    ga_diversity_lambda: 0.3
    ga_parallel_evaluations: 1
```

Notes:
- The `prompt_init` and `prompt_recombination` functions are defined in the `functions` section of the same config file
- These functions use the `prompt_optimizer` LLM to generate prompt variations based on the `system_objective`
- Increase `optimizer.numeric.n_trials` for a deeper search (for example, 20–50)
- To optimize prompts, set `optimizer.prompt.enabled: true`

### Run the Optimizer
From the repository root:

```bash
nat optimize --config_file examples/evaluation_and_profiling/email_phishing_analyzer/configs/config_optimizer.yml
```

Ensure `NVIDIA_API_KEY` is set in your environment.

### Outputs
Results are written to the path specified by `optimizer.output_path`. Expect artifacts such as:
- `optimized_config.yml`: Tuned configuration derived from the selected trial.
- You will also see a configuration file for each iteration of numeric trials. For example, `config_numeric_trial_0.yml`
  will contain the configuration for the first numeric trial. This is helpful for selecting specific trials whose metrics
  you may prefer to the optimizer selected trial.
- `trials_dataframe_params.csv`: Full Optuna trials `dataframe` with columns:
  - `values_accuracy`, `values_token_efficiency`, `values_latency`: Metric scores (named after your `eval_metrics`)
  - `params_*`: Parameter values for each trial
  - `datetime_start`, `datetime_complete`, `duration`: Timing information
  - `rep_scores`: Raw scores for each repetition
- `plots`: This directory will contain Pareto visualizations of the optimization results.
- For prompt optimization (when enabled): `optimized_prompts.json` and per-generation prompt history. Per generation prompt
  history files are named `optimized_prompts_gen{N}.json` where `{N}` is the generation number starting from 1.

#### Understanding the Pareto Visualizations

For a detailed guide on interpreting the output of the optimization process, including the 
Pareto visualizations, refer to the [Optimizer Output Analysis](../../../docs/source/improve-workflows/optimizer.md#understanding-the-output) section in the 
NeMo Agent Toolkit documentation.

## Deployment-Oriented Setup

For a production deployment, use Docker:

### Build the Docker Image

Prior to building the Docker image ensure that you have followed the steps in the [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) section, and you are currently in the NeMo Agent Toolkit virtual environment.

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent Toolkit repository, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --build-arg NAT_VERSION=$(python -m setuptools_scm) -t email_phishing_analyzer -f examples/evaluation_and_profiling/email_phishing_analyzer/Dockerfile .
```

### Run the Docker Container
Deploy the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e NVIDIA_API_KEY email_phishing_analyzer
```

### Test the API
Use the following curl command to test the deployed API:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/generate' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input_message": "Dear [Customer], Thank you for your purchase on [Date]. We have processed a refund of $[Amount] to your account. Please provide your account and routing numbers so we can complete the transaction. Thank you, [Your Company]"}'
```

### Expected API Output
The API response should look like this:

```json
{"value":"This email is likely a phishing attempt. It requests sensitive information, such as account and routing numbers, which is a common tactic used by scammers. The email also lacks specific details about the purchase, which is unusual for a refund notification. Additionally, the greeting is impersonal, which suggests a lack of personalization. It is recommended to be cautious when responding to such emails and to verify the authenticity of the email before providing any sensitive information."}
```
