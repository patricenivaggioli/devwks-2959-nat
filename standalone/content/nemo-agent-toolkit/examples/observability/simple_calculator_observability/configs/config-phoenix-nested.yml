# This config demonstrates NESTED TOOL CALLS for testing parent-child span tracking.
#
# The power_of_two tool internally calls calculator__multiply, creating a hierarchy:
#   react_agent -> power_of_two -> calculator__multiply
#
# In Phoenix, you can filter spans by parent:
#   - nat.function.parent_name = "react_agent" -> shows power_of_two (agent-selected tool)
#   - nat.function.parent_name = "power_of_two" -> shows calculator__multiply (nested call)
