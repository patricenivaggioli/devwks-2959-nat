# Reinforcement Learning with OpenPipe ART: Tic-Tac-Toe Example

**Complexity:** 🛑 Advanced

This example demonstrates how to use the NeMo Agent Toolkit finetuning harness with [OpenPipe ART](https://art.openpipe.ai/) (Agent Reinforcement Trainer) to improve an LLM's performance at playing Tic-Tac-Toe through reinforcement learning.

The model learns to play against a **random opponent**, receiving rewards based on game-theoretic position evaluation rather than simple win/loss outcomes. This continuous reward signal enables more effective learning than sparse binary rewards.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| GPU | 40GB VRAM (A100) | 80GB VRAM (H100) |
| RAM | 32GB | 64GB |
| Storage | 50GB free | 100GB free |

> **Note**: The Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model requires approximately 20GB of VRAM for inference and additional memory for training gradients. An 80GB H100 provides comfortable headroom for larger batch sizes and sequence lengths.

### Software Requirements

1. **Python 3.11+**

2. **NeMo Agent Toolkit** with the OpenPipe ART plugin. This example is meant to be run using a NeMo Agent Toolkit
   installation from source. You can follow the [NeMo Agent Toolkit Installation Guide](../../../docs/source/get-started/installation.md) to set up your environment.


3. **OpenPipe ART** installed in a **separate virtual environment**:

   OpenPipe ART has specific dependency requirements that may conflict with NeMo Agent Toolkit. We recommend installing it in an isolated environment:

   ```bash
   # Create a separate virtual environment for ART
   uv venv art-env --python 3.13
   source art-env/bin/activate
   export HF_TOKEN=<your_huggingface_token>
   # Install OpenPipe ART
   uv pip install --no-cache 'openpipe-art[backend]==0.4.11'

   # Verify installation
   art --help
   ```

   For detailed installation instructions, see the [OpenPipe ART Getting Started Guide](https://art.openpipe.ai/getting-started/about).

4. **This example package in your NeMo Agent Toolkit environment**:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e examples/finetuning/rl_with_openpipe_art
   ```
   
5. The rest of this example assumes you are in the root of the NeMo Agent Toolkit repository. Please execute
   all commands from there.

---

## How the Example Works

### The Task

The LLM plays Tic-Tac-Toe against a **random opponent**. In each game:

1. The LLM is assigned a role (`X` or `O`)
2. Players alternate turns, with `X` always going first
3. The LLM must output valid moves in XML format:
   ```xml
   <move>
     <row>2</row>
     <col>2</col>
   </move>
   ```
4. The game continues until someone wins or the board is full (draw)

### Why a Random Opponent?

Training against a random opponent provides several benefits:

- **Consistent difficulty**: The opponent doesn't improve, providing a stable training signal
- **Exploitable patterns**: The model can learn to capitalize on random mistakes
- **Clear improvement signal**: Win rate against random play is a meaningful metric
- **Faster iteration**: No need to manage self-play complexity

Against a random opponent, a perfect Tic-Tac-Toe player should win or draw almost every game (winning ~95% when going first as X).

### The Workflow

The workflow is defined in `src/rl_with_openpipe_art/rl_with_openpipe_art.py`:

```python
@register_function(config_type=RlWithOpenpipeArtFunctionConfig)
async def rl_with_openpipe_art_function(config, builder):
    player_model = await builder.get_llm(config.player_model)
    opponent_model = await builder.get_llm(config.opponent_model) if config.opponent_model else player_model

    async def _play_game(role: str) -> str:
        # Create players
        player_x = LLMTicTacToePlayer(...)  # X goes first
        player_o = LLMTicTacToePlayer(...)

        # Run the game
        game = TicTacToeGame(player_x, player_o, role)
        winner = game.play()

        # Return result
        if role == "X":
            return "Win!" if winner == 1 else "Lose!" if winner == -1 else "Draw!"
        else:
            return "Win!" if winner == -1 else "Lose!" if winner == 1 else "Draw!"

    yield FunctionInfo.from_fn(_play_game)
```

The workflow:
1. Creates two LLM players (or one LLM + one random player)
2. Runs a complete game, tracking intermediate steps
3. Records move quality scores at each step for reward shaping
4. Returns the game outcome

### Training Data

The training data (`data/data.json`) contains game scenarios:

```json
[
  {"id": 1, "question": "X", "answer": "Win!"},
  {"id": 2, "question": "O", "answer": "Win!"},
  ...
]
```

- `question`: The role the LLM plays (`X` or `O`)
- `answer`: The expected outcome (always `Win!` since the goal is to learn to win)

---

## Step 1: Running Pre-Training Baseline Evaluation

Before training, establish a baseline to measure improvement.

### 1.1 Start the vLLM Inference Server

In your **ART virtual environment**, start vLLM to serve the base model:

```bash
# Activate the ART environment
source art-env/bin/activate
export HF_TOKEN=<your_huggingface_token>
# Start vLLM server
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
    --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
```

Wait for the server to fully load the model. You should see:
```
INFO:     Started server process
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

Verify the server is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/models
```

### 1.2 Run Pre-Training Evaluation

In a **separate terminal** with your NeMo Agent Toolkit environment activated:

```bash
# This is a dummy key for local vLLM usage
export OPENAI_API_KEY=default
# Run the pre-training evaluation
nat eval --config_file examples/finetuning/rl_with_openpipe_art/configs/config_pre_train.yml --reps 3
```

This runs 72 games (12 as X, 12 as O, 3 times each) and reports the win percentage.

Record this baseline score for comparison after training.

### 1.3 Stop the vLLM Server

Once the evaluation completes, stop the vLLM server (`Ctrl+C`) to free GPU memory for training.

---

## Step 2: Starting the OpenPipe ART Training Server

The ART server handles both inference and training. It runs vLLM for serving the model and TorchTune for GRPO weight updates.

In your **ART virtual environment**:

```bash
# Activate the ART environment
source art-env/bin/activate
export HF_TOKEN=<your_huggingface_token>

# Start the ART server
art --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7623
```

> **Note**: The ART server listens on port `7623` for training commands and starts vLLM internally on port `8000` for inference.

Wait for the server to initialize. You should see output indicating:
- Training server ready
- API endpoints available

Sample output:
```bash
INFO:     Started server process [3671624]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:7623 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```


## Step 3: Running Finetuning

With the ART server running, start the finetuning process.

### 3.1 Review the Training Configuration

The training configuration is in `src/rl_with_openpipe_art/configs/config.yml`:

```yaml
llms:
  openpipe_llm:
    _type: openai
    model_name: Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
    base_url: http://localhost:8000/v1
    api_key: default
    temperature: 0.4  # Some randomness for exploration

workflow:
  _type: rl_with_openpipe_art
  player_model: openpipe_llm
  max_parser_retries: 2  # Retry on malformed XML

eval:
  general:
    max_concurrency: 16  # Parallel game execution
    output_dir: .tmp/nat/examples/rl_openpipe/eval/finetune
    dataset:
      _type: json
      file_path: examples/finetuning/rl_with_openpipe_art/data/data.json

  evaluators:
    rl_accuracy:
      _type: step_value_computation  # Uses alpha-beta reward function

trajectory_builders:
  openpipe_traj_builder:
    _type: openpipe_art_traj_builder
    num_generations: 1  # Games per example per epoch

trainer_adapters:
  openpipe_trainer_adapter:
    _type: openpipe_art_trainer_adapter
    backend:
      ip: "0.0.0.0"
      port: 7623
      name: "tic_tac_toe_training"
      project: "tic_tac_toe_project"
      base_model: "Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct"
      api_key: "default"
      init_args:
        max_seq_length: 8192
      engine_args:
        gpu_memory_utilization: 0.9
        tensor_parallel_size: 1
    training:
      learning_rate: 1e-6  # Conservative learning rate

finetuning:
  enabled: true
  trainer: openpipe_trainer
  trajectory_builder: openpipe_traj_builder
  trainer_adapter: openpipe_trainer_adapter
  reward_function:
    name: rl_accuracy
  num_epochs: 10
  output_dir: ./.tmp/nat/finetuning/tic_tac_toe
```

### 3.2 Start Training

In your **NeMo Agent Toolkit environment**:

```bash
# This is a dummy key for local vLLM usage
export OPENAI_API_KEY=default
nat finetune --config_file examples/finetuning/rl_with_openpipe_art/configs/config.yml
```

### 3.3 Monitor Training Progress

Training progress is logged to the console and saved to files:

```
INFO - Starting finetuning with config: src/rl_with_openpipe_art/configs/config.yml
INFO - Initializing OpenPipe ART Runner
INFO - Successfully registered with ART backend.
INFO - Starting finetuning run with 30 epochs

INFO - Starting epoch 1 for run art_run_a1b2c3d4
INFO - Starting 1 evaluation runs for run_id: art_run_a1b2c3d4
INFO - Built 48 trajectories across 48 examples
INFO - Epoch 1 progress logged - Avg Reward: 0.4523, Trajectories: 48
INFO - Training art_run_a1b2c3d4 completed successfully.
INFO - Completed epoch 1/30

INFO - Starting epoch 2 for run art_run_a1b2c3d4
...
```

Training typically takes upwards of 40 minutes for 10 epochs on an H100.

---

## Step 4: Understanding the Reward Function

The reward function is the key to effective RL training. This example uses a sophisticated **alpha-beta pruning based reward** instead of simple win/loss signals.

### 4.1 Why Not Use Simple Win/Loss Rewards?

Simple win/loss rewards have significant problems for training:

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Sparsity** | Reward only at game end (after 5-9 moves) |
| **Credit assignment** | Which moves caused the win/loss? |
| **No gradient for draws** | Draws give 0 reward, no learning signal |
| **Binary signal** | No difference between "barely won" and "dominated" |

### 4.2 Alpha-Beta Pruning: A Primer

**Alpha-beta pruning** is a search algorithm that determines the optimal play in two-player games. It works by:

1. **Building a game tree**: All possible future moves and responses
2. **Minimax evaluation**: Assuming both players play optimally
3. **Pruning branches**: Skipping moves that can't affect the outcome

For Tic-Tac-Toe, alpha-beta can solve the entire game tree, determining:
- **Forced win**: A position where perfect play guarantees victory
- **Forced loss**: A position where the opponent can force a win
- **Drawn position**: Neither player can force a win

### 4.3 The Reward Function Implementation

The reward function is implemented in two files:

#### `core.py`: Position Evaluation (`evaluate_board_for_player`)

Located at: `src/rl_with_openpipe_art/core.py:110-285`

```python
def evaluate_board_for_player(board: np.ndarray, player_val: int) -> float:
    """
    Evaluate the position from the perspective of `player_val`.

    Output ranges:
      - Non-terminal positions: [0, 1] continuous
      - Forced future win: (1, 11] = base + 10
      - Immediate win: (1, 16] = base + 15
      - Forced loss or already lost: 0.0
    """
```

The function combines two components:

**1. Static Heuristic Evaluation** (continuous, no search):

```python
def static_eval(b: np.ndarray) -> float:
    """Heuristic position evaluation in [-1, 1]."""
    # Count threats, control, position quality
    score_raw = (
        4.0 * (my_two_open - opp_two_open)    # Strong threats
        + 1.5 * (my_one_open - opp_one_open)  # Influence
        + 1.5 * center                         # Center control
        + 0.75 * corners.sum()                 # Corner control
        + 0.25 * edges.sum()                   # Edge control
    )
    return float(np.tanh(score_raw / 5.0))  # Squash to [-1, 1]
```

**2. Game-Theoretic Solver** (alpha-beta search):

```python
def solve_outcome(b: np.ndarray, side_to_move: int, alpha=-1.0, beta=1.0) -> float:
    """
    Full-depth minimax with alpha-beta pruning.
    Returns: +1 (forced win), 0 (draw), -1 (forced loss)
    """
    # Recursively evaluate all possible continuations
    # Prune branches that can't improve the result
    if side_to_move == player_val:
        # Maximizing: find best move for us
        for move in available_moves(b):
            best = max(best, solve_outcome(child, -side_to_move, alpha, beta))
            alpha = max(alpha, best)
            if alpha >= beta:
                break  # Beta cut-off
    else:
        # Minimizing: opponent's best response
        for move in available_moves(b):
            best = min(best, solve_outcome(child, -side_to_move, alpha, beta))
            beta = min(beta, best)
            if alpha >= beta:
                break  # Alpha cut-off
    return best
```

**3. Combined Reward Mapping**:

| Position Type | Reward Range | Description |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Already lost | `0.0` | Terminal loss state |
| Forced future loss | `0.0` | Opponent can force win |
| Game-theoretic draw | `[0, 1]` | Continuous heuristic |
| Non-terminal (no forced outcome) | `[0, 1]` | Continuous heuristic |
| Forced future win | `base + 10` | `(1, 11]` |
| Immediate win (on board) | `base + 15` | `(1, 16]` |

#### `accuracy_evaluator.py`: Episode Reward Aggregation

Located at: `src/rl_with_openpipe_art/accuracy_evaluator.py:39-72`

```python
@staticmethod
def episode_value_from_states(
    state_values: list[float],  # Rewards from each move
    gamma_base: float = 0.8,    # Temporal discount
    delta_bonus: float = 0.95,  # Bonus decay
) -> float:
    """Compute episode value with temporal discounting."""
    s = np.asarray(state_values, dtype=float)
    T = len(s) - 1

    # 1) Split into base [0,1] and bonus (>0 if forced/actual win)
    base = np.minimum(s, 1.0)
    bonus = np.maximum(s - 1.0, 0.0)

    # 2) Reverse-discounted base: earlier moves matter more
    exponents = np.arange(T, -1, -1)  # T, T-1, ..., 0
    w = gamma_base ** exponents
    w = w / w.sum()
    R_base = float(np.dot(w, base))  # Weighted average in [0, 1]

    # 3) Bonus: max spike, time-decayed (reward early wins)
    if np.any(bonus > 0):
        bonus_weights = delta_bonus ** exponents
        U_time = float(np.max(bonus * bonus_weights))
    else:
        U_time = 0.0

    # 4) Final episode score
    return R_base + U_time
```

### 4.4 Why This Reward Function Works

| Property | Benefit for RL |
|----------|----------------|
| **Continuous** | Smooth gradients, stable training |
| **Dense** | Reward at every move, not just game end |
| **Informative** | Distinguishes good moves from great moves |
| **Theoretically grounded** | Based on perfect play analysis |
| **Temporally weighted** | Earlier good moves are more valuable |
| **Bonus for winning** | Strong signal to learn winning patterns |

### 4.5 How Intermediate Steps Are Tracked

During each game, the workflow records move quality:

```python
# In rl_with_openpipe_art.py
if current_player.name == self.role:
    # Record intermediate step with position value
    self.step_manager.push_intermediate_step(
        IntermediateStepPayload(
            event_type=IntermediateStepType.CUSTOM_END,
            name="agent_move",
            metadata={
                "step": turn_index,
                "value": evaluate_board_for_player(self.board, current_player.value)
            }
        )
    )
```

The evaluator then aggregates these step-level values into an episode reward.

---

## Step 5: Viewing Training Logs and Metrics

### 5.1 Output Directory Structure

After training, check the output directory:

```
.tmp/nat/finetuning/tic_tac_toe/
├── training_metrics.jsonl      # Per-epoch metrics
├── reward_history.json         # Reward progression
├── reward_plot.png             # Visual reward chart
```

### 5.2 Training Metrics

The `training_metrics.jsonl` file contains detailed per-epoch data:

```json
{
  "epoch": 0,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:45.123456",
  "run_id": "art_run_a1b2c3d4",
  "avg_reward": 0.4523,
  "min_reward": 0.0,
  "max_reward": 1.2341,
  "num_trajectories": 48,
  "num_groups": 48
}
```

### 5.3 Example Reward Plot
When training is complete, view the reward progression plot. The Y-axis shows average episode reward, and the 
X-axis shows epochs. Your plot should look similar to this, but results may vary:

![Reward Plot](./static/art_reward_plot.png)

---

## Step 6: Running Post-Training Evaluation

After training completes, evaluate the improved model.

### 6.1 Keep the ART Server Running

The ART server continues serving the finetuned model weights. Do not restart it, as the updated weights are in memory.

### 6.2 Run Post-Training Evaluation

```bash
# This is a dummy key for local vLLM usage
export OPENAI_API_KEY=default
nat eval --config_file examples/finetuning/rl_with_openpipe_art/configs/config_post_train.yml --reps 3
```

Compare the post-training win percentage against the pre-training baseline. You should see a notable improvement.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to the stochastic nature of reinforcement learning, you may notice a decrease in performance in some training attempts. Please try running the training again or follow the troubleshooting guide below.

## Best Practices and Troubleshooting

### Training Parameter Suggestions

#### Learning Rate

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `1e-7` | Very stable, slow learning |
| `1e-6` | **Recommended starting point** |
| `5e-6` | Faster learning, may be unstable |
| `1e-5` | Aggressive, risk of divergence |

#### Number of Generations (`num_generations`)

```yaml
trajectory_builders:
  openpipe_traj_builder:
    num_generations: 4  # Try 4-8 for better GRPO signal
```

More generations per example provide better comparison signal for GRPO but increase training time. 

When setting`num_generations` to 1, the trajectory builder uses all examples in the dataset in one large group.
Conversely, increasing `num_generations` causes each input data point to be evaluated multiple times per epoch, generating 
more trajectories and finer reward comparisons. Each example then gets its own group.

#### Temperature

```yaml
llms:
  openpipe_llm:
    temperature: 0.4  # Balance exploration/exploitation
```

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `0.0` | Deterministic, no exploration |
| `0.2-0.4` | **Recommended for training** |
| `0.6+` | High exploration, noisier gradients |
| `0.1` | Use for final evaluation (near-deterministic) |

#### Number of Epochs

Start with 20-30 epochs and monitor the reward plot. Stop if:
- Rewards plateau for 5+ epochs
- Validation performance decreases (overfitting)

### Curriculum Learning (Optional)

Enable curriculum learning for more stable training:

```yaml
finetuning:
  curriculum_learning:
    enabled: true
    initial_percentile: 0.3      # Start with easiest 30%
    increment_percentile: 0.2     # Add 20% each expansion
    expansion_interval: 5         # Expand every 5 epochs
```

### Common Issues

#### "Failed to connect to ART backend"

**Cause**: ART server not running or wrong port.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if ART server is running
curl http://localhost:7623/health
```

#### "CUDA out of memory"

**Cause**: Insufficient GPU memory.

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce `gpu_memory_utilization`:
   ```yaml
   engine_args:
     gpu_memory_utilization: 0.7
   ```
2. Reduce `max_seq_length`:
   ```yaml
   init_args:
     max_seq_length: 4096
   ```
3. Reduce `max_concurrency`:
   ```yaml
   eval:
     general:
       max_concurrency: 8
   ```

#### "No trajectories collected"

**Cause**: Workflow not producing intermediate steps or evaluator errors.

**Solutions**:
1. Check workflow registration:
   ```bash
   nat info --components
   ```
2. Verify evaluator is registered:
   ```bash
   nat info --evaluators
   ```
3. Run a single game manually to debug:
   ```bash
   nat eval --config_file=... --max_examples=1
   ```

#### "Model outputs invalid XML"

**Cause**: Model not following the prompt format.

**Solutions**:
1. Increase `max_parser_retries`:
   ```yaml
   workflow:
     max_parser_retries: 3
   ```
2. Lower temperature for more deterministic outputs
3. Check if base model supports the task (try a larger model)

#### "Rewards not improving"

**Possible causes**:
1. **Learning rate too low**: Try `5e-6`
2. **Not enough generations**: Increase `num_generations` to 2-4
3. **Model already optimal**: Check if baseline is already high
4. **Reward function issue**: Verify evaluator is computing rewards correctly

### Performance Optimization

1. **Increase batch parallelism**:
   ```yaml
   eval:
     general:
       max_concurrency: 32  # If GPU memory allows
   ```

2. **Use multiple generations**:
   ```yaml
   trajectory_builders:
     openpipe_traj_builder:
       num_generations: 4  # Better GRPO signal
   ```

3. **Enable prefix caching** (vLLM):
   ```bash
   python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
       --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct \
       --enable-prefix-caching
   ```
