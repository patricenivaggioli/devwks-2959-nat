    "\n",
    "We'll use LangGraph's Deep Research agent as a comprehensive example to demonstrate how you can wrap existing LangGraph agents so they work seamlessly with NeMo Agent Toolkit features like configurable LLMs, telemetry and observability with Phoenix, and comprehensive evaluation frameworks-all without refactoring the original agent code.\n",

    "The techniques shown here apply to any LangGraph agent, making it easy to add powerful capabilities provided by NeMo Agent Toolkit to your existing LangGraph applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we'll use LangGraph's Deep Research agent as our example. It's a sophisticated multi-agent system that showcases many advanced LangGraph patterns, making it an excellent demonstration of how to integrate complex LangGraph applications with NeMo Agent Toolkit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Example?** The Deep Research agent is feature-rich and demonstrates:\n",
    "- Multi-step workflows with planning and execution\n",
    "- Sub-agent coordination and parallel processing\n",
    "- Custom tool integration (Tavily search, strategic thinking)\n",
    "- File system operations and context management\n",
    "- State management across multiple agents\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns are common in many LangGraph applications, so the integration techniques you'll learn here are widely applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep Research Agent Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Step Research Workflow:**\n",
    "1. Saves the research request\n",
    "2. Creates a structured plan with `TODO` items\n",
    "3. Delegates subtasks to specialized research sub-agents\n",
    "4. Synthesizes findings across multiple sources\n",
    "5. Responds with comprehensive analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Built-in DeepAgent Tools:**\n",
    "- `write_todos` and `read_todos`: Task planning and progress tracking\n",
    "- `ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`: File system operations\n",
    "- `glob` and `grep`: File search and pattern matching\n",
    "- `task`: Sub-agent delegation for isolated context windows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom Research Tools:**\n",
    "- `tavily_search`: Web search that fetches full webpage content\n",
    "- `think_tool`: Strategic reflection mechanism for planning next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sub-Agent Architecture:**\n",
    "The agent can spin up parallel research sub-agents (up to three concurrent) to investigate different aspects of a query simultaneously, with each sub-agent having its own isolated context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Original LangGraph Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Deep Research agent is defined in `external/lc-deepagents-quickstarts/deep_research/agent.py` and can be run using LangGraph's CLI through the `langgraph.json` [configuration file](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/cli#configuration-file):\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"dependencies\": [\".\"],\n",
    "  \"graphs\": {\n",
    "    \"research\": \"./agent.py:agent\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"env\": \".env\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration tells LangGraph's CLI:\n",
    "- Where to find dependencies (current directory)\n",
    "- Where to find the agent graph (`agent.py:agent`)\n",
    "- Where to load environment variables (`.env` file)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key insight:** The `langgraph_wrapper` workflow type provided by NeMo Agent Toolkit mimics this configuration pattern, allowing you to run most LangGraph agents that work with LangGraph CLI through NeMo Agent Toolkit—while adding powerful new capabilities like telemetry, evaluation, and configurable LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we'll see exactly how this integration works."
